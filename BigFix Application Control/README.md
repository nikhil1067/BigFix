# Unapproved Applications Management

This process involves uploading required files to the BigFix site, generating an unapproved applications list, and blocking blacklisted applications on client systems. If necessary, email notifications can also be sent to relevant stakeholders.

## Steps to Follow

### 1. **Upload Required Files**
   - Upload the following files to the `Files` section of your BigFix site:
     - `Email-IDDetails`
     - `Whitelisted Application Details`

### 2. **Distribute Files to Clients**
   - Ensure the uploaded files are sent to all BigFix clients.

### 3. **Run the Task to Generate Unapproved Application List**
   - Deploy the `Generate Unapproved Application List.bes` task.
   - This task will create a file in the BigFix Client directory containing a list of unapproved applications.

### 4. **Place Required Files**
   - Manually place the required files (generated by the previous task) in the BigFix Client directory on the respective endpoints.

### 5. **Run the Block Applications Task**
   - Deploy the `Block Applications.bes` task.
   - This task will terminate any applications listed in the blacklist.

## Notes
- Ensure all files are correctly formatted and up to date before uploading.
- Verify the success of the `Generate Unapproved Application List.bes` task before proceeding to the next step.
- Regularly review and update the whitelisted and blacklisted application lists as necessary.
- For email notifications, confirm that recipient details in the `Email-IDDetails` file are accurate and complete.
